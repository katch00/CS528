## Homeworks
### HW 1: k-Anonymity and l-Diversity (entropy and recursive)
- Based on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult
- Create reasonable heirarchies for each QIID
- Write a prgram for the algorithm which generalizes/suppresses the data for k-anonymity while minimizing the utility loss (Kanon.java)
- Write a program for the algorithm which generalizes/suppresses the data for Entropy l-diversity while minimizing the utility loss. (EntropyLDiversity.java)
- Write a program for the algorithm which generalizes/suppresses the data for Recursive (c,l)-diversity (RecursiveLDiversity.java)
- Calculate distortion and precision for the outputs of all three algorithms (DistortionPrecision.java
